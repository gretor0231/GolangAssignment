# Golang Tinder

Design an HTTP server for the Tinder matching system. The HTTP server must support the
following three APIs:

1. AddSinglePersonAndMatch : Add a new user to the matching system and find any
possible matches for the new user.

2. RemoveSinglePerson : Remove a user from the matching system so that the user
cannot be matched anymore.

3. QuerySinglePeople : Find the most N possible matched single people, where N is a
request parameter.
